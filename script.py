Idea Planning:
? What kind of recommendation system do you want to build?
I will build an entertainment recommendation system. 

? Who do you want to build something for? Yourself? Your friends? Your family? 
I want to build something that addresses an annoyance of mine, which hopefully would become something that others would want to use.

? What topics will be searchable in your recommendation system?
Users can input general information such as a media type as well as guidance information, such as a decade or a genre, and the system will return a recommendation of some form of entertainment.

Project Brainstorming:
? What does your program do?
My program will take in general information to help you narrow down a form of entertainment to consume.

I need a large collection of various pieces of entertainment; songs, movies, tv shows, games, etc. 
? What questions will you ask the user?
Guiding questions to help narrow down the type of entertainment the user is looking for

? How do the above questions combine to return a recommendation?
